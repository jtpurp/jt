My personal website created as a place to organize and express my education, professional experience, projects, hobbies, and interests in a creative way. I learned how to use React.js to build the front-end of the website. The Education, Experience, and Portfolio pages detail my accomplishments along with corresponding images that are links to relative external references. My hobbies and interests are showcased in the Flow Arts, Photos, and Music pages. The Flow Arts page displays some clips of my favorite flow moments and the Photos page contains some of my favorite pictures I’ve taken. The Music page was intended to be a music sharing service that connected to a RESTful API coded in Java and a database coded in PostgreSQL so that visitors could share music suggestions. For the purpose of being a live website hosted on github, I hardcoded the Music page with some of my music suggestions and included a music player for visitors to explore some of my music picks!
